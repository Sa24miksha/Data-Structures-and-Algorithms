//Binary Search - This is the very first article of the Binary Search series. Until now, we have learned the linear search algorithm. The linear search is a simple search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. The time complexity of the linear search is O(n).

//The binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

//The time complexity of the binary search is O(log n).

int binarySearch(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int n = nums.size(); //size of the array
    int low = 0, high = n - 1;

    // Perform the steps:
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (target > nums[mid]) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
