//Longest Subarray with given Sum K(Positives)
//Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

//Approach:
//Brute Force - Naive Approach: 
//using 3 pointers - i, j, sum. For each i, we will iterate j from i to n and keep adding the elements to sum. If sum becomes equal to k, then we will update the length of the longest subarray. This approach will take O(n^2) time.
