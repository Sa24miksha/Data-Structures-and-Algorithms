Backtracking : it a specific form of recurssion

Backtracking is a form of recursion. But it involves choosing only option out of any possibilities. We begin by choosing an option and backtrack from it, if we reach a state where we conclude that this specific option does not give the required solution. We repeat these steps by choosing another option until we get the desired solution.
